/* 
Creates a Redux store that holds the state tree. The only way to change the data in the store is to call dispatch() on it.

There should only be a single store in your app. To specify how different parts of the state tree respond to actions, you may combine several reducers into a single reducer function by using combineReducers.

@template S â€” State object type.

@param reducer
A function that returns the next state tree, given the current state tree and the action to handle.

@param preloadedState
The initial state. You may optionally specify it to hydrate the state from the server in universal apps, or to restore a previously serialized user session. If you use combineReducers to produce the root reducer function, this must be an object with the same shape as combineReducers keys.

@param enhancer
The store enhancer. You may optionally specify it to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware, time travel, persistence, etc. The only store enhancer that ships with Redux is applyMiddleware().

@returns
A Redux store that lets you read the state, dispatch actions and subscribe to changes.
